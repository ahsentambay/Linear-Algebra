# Sympy Matrices


When you want to work by using symbols for linear algebra in Python, calculus, geometric operations, you can use the Sympy library. If all your entries will be numbers then you can use libraries in Python like Numpy or Scipy. Especially in solution operations, numpy will help you more easily. Sympy library is completely based on symbolic operation logic. For example, in your matrix containing symbols, you will need to perform operations by separating the symbol and integer differences. You can find an example of this in my work.
Summarize, with this study, my aim was to show how we can do basic matrix operations in linear algebra with the Sympy library in Python.
