# Sympy Library in Python and Matrices

When you want to work in Python using symbols for linear algebra, calculus, geometric operations, you can use the Sympy library. If all your entries will be numbers, you can use libraries like Numpy or Scipy in Python. Advantage of Sympy, you can construct your matrices by defining symbolic variables. This ensures that the variables can be a symbol in your matrices are neither integers nor syntaxes. In this way, you can view your operations through your symbols and assign a convenience variable. An important point to note is to separate the difference between symbols and integers so that you can operate in a matrix structure containing symbols and numbers at the same time. You can find an example of this in my work. In summary, my aim with this study was to show how we can do basic matrix operations in linear algebra with the Sympy library in Python.
